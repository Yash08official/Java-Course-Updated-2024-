### How JVM Works - JVM Architecture?

VM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications. JVM is the one that actually calls the main method present in a java code. JVM is a part of JRE(Java Runtime Environment).<br>

ava applications are called WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). This means a programmer can develop Java code on one system and can expect it to run on any other Java-enabled system without any adjustment. This is all possible because of JVM.<br>

When we compile a .java file, .class files(contains byte-code) with the same class names present in .java file are generated by the Java compiler. This .class file goes into various steps when we run it. These steps together describe the whole JVM. <br>

<b>Class Loader Subsystem</b>

It is mainly responsible for three activities.

<ul>
<li>Loading</li>
<li>Linking</li>
<li>Initialization</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Loading:</b>The Class loader reads the “.class” file, generate the corresponding binary data and save it in the method area. For each “.class” file, JVM stores the following information in the method area.

<ul>
<li>The fully qualified name of the loaded class and its immediate parent class.</li>
<li>Whether the “.class” file is related to Class or Interface or Enum.</li>
<li>Modifier, Variables and Method information etc.</li>
</ul>

After loading the “.class” file, JVM creates an object of type Class to represent this file in the heap memory. Please note that this object is of type Class predefined in java.lang package. These Class object can be used by the programmer for getting class level information like the name of the class, parent name, methods and variable information etc. To get this object reference we can use getClass() method of Object class.

```
// A Java program to demonstrate working
// of a Class type object created by JVM
// to represent .class file in memory.
import java.lang.reflect.Field;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

// Java code to demonstrate use
// of Class object created by JVM
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Student s1 = new Student();

        // Getting hold of Class
        // object created by JVM.
        Class c1 = s1.getClass();

        // Printing type of object using c1.
        System.out.println(c1.getName());

        // getting all methods in an array
        Method m[] = c1.getDeclaredMethods();
        for (Method method : m)
            System.out.println(method.getName());

        // getting all fields in an array
        Field f[] = c1.getDeclaredFields();
        for (Field field : f)
            System.out.println(field.getName());
    }
}

// A sample class whose information
// is fetched above using its Class object.
class Student {
    private String name;
    private int roll_No;

    public String getName() { return name; }
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public int getRoll_no() { return roll_No; }
    public void setRoll_no(int roll_no)
    {
        this.roll_No = roll_no;
    }
}
```

<em>Output:</em>

```
Student
getName
setName
getRoll_no
setRoll_no
name
roll_No
```

<imp>Note: For every loaded “.class” file, only one object of the class is created. </imp>

<p>Student s2 = new Student();
// c2 will point to same object where 
// c1 is pointing
Class c2 = s2.getClass();
System.out.println(c1==c2); // true
</p>

<b>Linking:</b>Performs verification, preparation, and (optionally) resolution.

<ul>
<li>Verification: It ensures the correctness of the .class file i.e. it checks whether this file is properly formatted and generated by a valid compiler or not. If verification fails, we get run-time exception java.lang.VerifyError. This activity is done by the component ByteCodeVerifier. Once this activity is completed then the class file is ready for compilation.</li>
<li>Preparation: JVM allocates memory for class variables and initializing the memory to default values.</li>
<li>Resolution: It is the process of replacing symbolic references from the type with direct references. It is done by searching into the method area to locate the referenced entity.</li>
</ul>

<b>Initialization:</b>In this phase, all static variables are assigned with their values defined in the code and static block(if any). This is executed from top to bottom in a class and from parent to child in the class hierarchy.
In general, there are three class loaders :

<ul>
<li>Bootstrap class loader: Every JVM implementation must have a bootstrap class loader, capable of loading trusted classes. It loads core java API classes present in the “JAVA_HOME/jre/lib” directory. This path is popularly known as the bootstrap path. It is implemented in native languages like C, C++.</li>
<li>Extension class loader: It is a child of the bootstrap class loader. It loads the classes present in the extensions directories “JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext”(Extension path) or any other directory specified by the java.ext.dirs system property. It is implemented in java by the sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader class</li>
<li>System/Application class loader: It is a child of the extension class loader. It is responsible to load classes from the application classpath. It internally uses Environment Variable which mapped to java.class.path. It is also implemented in Java by the sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader class.</li>
</ul>

```
// Java code to demonstrate Class Loader subsystem
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // String class is loaded by bootstrap loader, and
        // bootstrap loader is not Java object, hence null
        System.out.println(String.class.getClassLoader());

        // Test class is loaded by Application loader
        System.out.println(Test.class.getClassLoader());
    }
}
```
