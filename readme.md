# Java Learning Journey
=======================

A personal knowledge base for my Java learning journey, featuring notes, code examples, and projects that I've worked on as I learn and explore the language.


<h1>Java | How to start learning Java</h1>

Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. A platform is an environment that helps to develop and run programs written in any programming language.
Java is fast, reliable, and secure. From desktop to web applications, scientific supercomputers to gaming consoles, cell phones to the Internet, Java is used in every nook and corner.

<h2>Features of Java </h2>
<br>
<h3>Java is a simple language:</h3> Java is easy to learn and its syntax is clear and concise. It is based on C++ (so it is easier for programmers who know C++). Java has removed many confusing and rarely-used features e.g. explicit pointers, operator overloading, etc. Java also takes care of memory management and it also provides an automatic garbage collector. This collects the unused objects automatically.
<br>
<h3>Java is a platform-independent language:</h3>  The programs written in Java language, after compilation, are converted into an intermediate level language called the bytecode which is a part of the Java platform irrespective of the machine on which the programs run. This makes java highly portable as its byte codes can be run on any machine by an interpreter called the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) and thus java provides 'reusability of code'.
<h3>Java is an object-oriented programming language:</h3>  OOP makes the complete program simpler by dividing it into a number of objects. The objects can be used as a bridge to have data flow from one function to another. We can easily modify data and function's as per the requirements of the program.
Java is a secure language: Java is recognized for its security features; Java's security features include-
<ul> <li> No use of pointer directly: </li>

<li>Its robust sandbox environment:</li> A robust sandbox environment refers to a secure and isolated execution environment where software programs can run safely without affecting the rest of the system. In the context of Java, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provides this sandbox environment.

<h3>JVM (java Virtual Machine):</h3> Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the JVM. The JVM provides a controlled execution environment, enforcing strict access controls and runtime security checks. This isolation helps prevent unauthorized access to system resources and protects against many common security threats.
<h3>Operating System (OS) Execution:</h3> C++ programs are typically compiled into machine code that directly interacts with the operating system. While this offers more direct control over system resources, it also increases the risk of security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and memory corruption, if not managed carefully.
<br>
So, while it's true that Java's use of the JVM provides additional security through its controlled execution environment, it's not solely because Java uses the JVM for execution. Other security features inherent to the language and runtime environment also contribute to Java's reputation for security.

<h3>Java is a robust(strong) language:</h3> Hereâ€™s is what makes java a robust language-
Bytecode Verification: Before executing Java bytecode, the JVM performs bytecode verification to ensure that it adheres to the language's rules and does not violate security constraints. This process helps prevent certain types of security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or type mismatches.
<br>
<h3>Memory Management:</h3> Java's automatic memory management, handled by the JVM's garbage collector, helps prevent memory-related security vulnerabilities like memory leaks or dangling pointers. The garbage collector deal locates memory automatically, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to memory locations.
<br>
<h3>Security Manager:</h3> Java's security model includes a Security Manager component that defines a set of permissions for Java code. The Security Manager enforces these permissions to control what actions Java programs can perform, such as reading or writing files, opening network connections, or accessing system properties.
<br>
<h3>ClassLoader:</h3> ClassLoader in Java is responsible for loading classes into memory at runtime. It works by searching for classes in various sources such as the class path, and when requested, loads the bytecode of a class file into memory for execution. ClassLoader provide the foundation for access control, code integrity, and runtime security enforcement. By leveraging ClassLoaders effectively, Java applications can maintain a secure and robust runtime environment.
<br>
<h3>Java is a multithreaded language:</h3> Java can perform many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. For example, a program that manages a Graphical User Interface (GUI) while waiting for input from a network connection uses another thread to perform and wait's instead of using the default GUI thread for both tasks. This keeps the GUI responsive.
<br>
<h3>Java programs can create applets:</h3> Applets are programs that run in web browsers. But applets support was deprecated in Java 9 release and has been removed in Java 11 release due to waning browser support for the Java plugin.
<br>
<h3>Java does not require any preprocessor:</h3>  It does not require inclusion of header files for creating a Java application.
<br>
<h3>Tips to learn Java</h3>
<ul>
<li>Understand the basics:</li>
 Learning the basics of any programming language is very important. It is the best way to begin learning something new. Don't have any anxiety, begin learning the concepts about the language. Get familiar with the environment, and slowly you will get used to it within no time. Here are a few links to get you started:
Java - Overview
Java - Basics(Articles)
Java - Basics (Videos)
OOP - Concept
<li>Patience is the key:</li> Learning Java will be overwhelming because of the volume of material about the language but be patient, learn at your own pace, don't rush. Mastering Java is a process that takes time. And remember even the best coders would have started at some point. So it's not a big deal, just do as much as you can and keep going. Give it your time. Patience is the key to success.
<li>Practice Coding</li>  Once you have understood the basics, the best thing to do is to brush up your skills with regular practice. True knowledge comes only when you implement what you've learned, as is said 'Practice Makes a Man Perfect'. So, code more than you read. This will build your confidence. Remember Perfect Practice makes you Perfect. Practice Coding: You can increase your coding skills here. Happy Coding!
<li>Read about Java regularly</li>  Continuously read about the various topics in Java and try to explore more. This will help to maintain your interest in Java. Go through this link to explore the vast world of Java: Explore Java >> Recent articles on Java >>
<li>Study in a group</li> Group study is a better way to learn something. This way you get to know about new things about the topic as everyone presents their ideas and you can discuss and solve your coding problems on the spot. Get to know a common group of people who are willing to learn java. Get help from a tutor and read as many books about java as possible. There are many good books in the market that will help you in learning java.
