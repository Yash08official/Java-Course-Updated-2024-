### Data types in Java

Data types are different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable that is made as per convenience and circumstances to cover up all test cases. Also, let us cover up other important ailments that there are majorly two types of languages that are as follows:

<ol>
<li>First, one is a Statically typed language where each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types. For example C, C++, Java.</li>
<li>The other is Dynamically typed languages. These languages can receive different data types over time. For example Ruby, Python</li>
</ol>
Java is statically typed and also a strongly typed language because, in Java, each type of data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth) is predefined as part of the programming language and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the data types.
